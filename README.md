## URL-shortner

Have you been annoyed by the length of some urls and think to yourself "Is there a way to make them shorter?".

YES THERE IS! This app is a url shortner in where the user gives the long/original url and a shortend version is given to him.
In order to run this locally make sure to install golang.

First clone this repo:
````bash
git clone https://github.com/AmanuelIsaak/URL-shortner
``````

Before running to code use this command to install the packages and resolve some inconsistencies with the packages:
````bash
go mod tidy
``````

And then run:
````bash
go run main.go
``````

Finally switch to your browser to open "http://localhost:8080/"


Enjoy!
